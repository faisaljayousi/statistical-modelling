# Statistical Modelling

This repository hosts a curated collection of stand-alone Jupyter notebooks dedicated to probability and statistics, covering both frequentist and Bayesian methods. These notebooks draw from materials I helped develop as a teaching assistant at the University of CÃ´te d'Azur (UCA) and from personal projects.
